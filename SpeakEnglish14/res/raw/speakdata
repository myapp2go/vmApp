[beat_bait]
i hate this heat

the run in the rain
that sum is not the same
what can you gain with a gun?
[bait_boat]
please taste the toast

the goat broke the gate
a bear will doze for days
[bet_bat]
this bed is bad
i guess they want gas
the gem fell in the jam
what she said make me sad

[bet_but]
they fled from the flood
it was done in the den
did chuck get my check?
a duck is on the deck
our pup has no pep
[pet_pot]
has the yacht sailed yet?
ships wreck on that rock
the rod was red
please stop on the step
it was not over the net
[bat_but]
my hat is in the hut
the city dump is often damp
ducks paddle in this puddle
she makes rugs from old rags

she sang a song
[bat_bite]

[cut_cot]
i hope that's not a nut
that hut was certainly hot
i hate to slosh through this slush
hand this cup to the cop
is that a duck on the dock?
[buck_book]
the book cost a buck
the tailor took a tuck
it is good luck to look
it doesn't look like good luck
he told huck to help find the hook
[but_boat]
he must have the most
has your coat been cut?
please come and bring a comb
it flowed because of the flood
the holes are full of hulls
[but_bought]

[cot_coat]
i hope you can hop
it's not in the note
who's got your goat?

[cot_caught]
her skirt caught on the cot
he taught the little tot
it did not come to nought
the police sought the miserable sot
it was chock full of chalk
[dot_doubt]

the clout caused a clot
he is bound to buy a bond
i heard a shout followed by a shot
[ball_boil]

will you call about the coil?
she was poised as she paused
[pull_pool]

that could be the code
please pull on the pole

[bowl_boil]
will joan get to join?
that boy is her beau
he told how they toiled
toss the coin into the cone
at the most they will only be moist
[bout_bite]
she cried to the crowd
he lied out loud
he signed without a sound
it turned brown in the brine
he's proud of his son's pride
[bought_boy]
that boy didn't bow
an owl likes oil
he fed soy to the sow
our plans were foiled when he fouled
the cow seemed almost coy
[boy_buy]
it was roy who wanted rye
we'll try to visit troy
please point to the pint
was it lloyd who lied?
they coined the wrong kind
[Mac_Wac]
that wine is mine
it is worn by those who mourn
he made a wager about the major
remind her to rewind the clock
the bloom was blue
[ham_hang]
he hangs the best hams

the ring is on the rim
was that sam who sang?
can you bring it to the brim?
[pack_back]
the pig is big
please buy a pie
the pony is rather bony
make it stable with a staple
the driver's cap matches his cab
[pat_fat]
it won't fit in the pit
he faints when he paints
the puppy looks puffy
the chief wants it cheap
he had to leap to get the leaf
[bad_dad]
that tree's bark is awfully dark
the boy blew a bubble that was double
besides being bent, it has a dent
does the ladle have a label?
he tried to find the tribe
[whack_hack]
i do not know whether this is heather
he hurt his heel on the wheel
just where is his hair?
but why say hi?
which shall i hitch?
[Wac_whack]
just which is a witch?
i wish it wouldn't whish
i don't care a whit about his wit
he heard a whine as he tasted the wine
i don't know whether we'll have good weather
[west_vest]
it would be wiser to clean the visor
did walt put it in the vault?
my verse is getting worse
they roved down the road
violets grow in that grove
[Wac_rack]
those reeds are just weeds
i will wait to hear the rate
the way he was reared is very weird
a rose never roars
can he mow a little more?
[wag_gag]
please wait by the gate
don't get all wet
he gave a big wave
the cougar was not a cooer
few know the fugue
[fat_vat]
our fan is in the van
i don't feel like eating veal
only a few can see this view
his rival had a rifle
can you save enough to feel safe?
[fane_thane]
that fin is thin
first let's quench our thirst
if you buy three you get one free
being ruthless, he left them roofless
did ruth climb on the roof?
[fame_shame]
that shine is fine
did she pay the fee?
they were fed in the shed
he is blushing because he is bluffing
they paid cash for the calf
[fat_sat]
the sign is fine
that slat is flat
he was miffed when he missed
he laughed last
don't muss my muff
[fat_hat]
her hair is fair
he found a hound
after his fumble he was humble
i hate my fate
he was rehired and then refired
[vat_bat]
this vest is best
the vent was bent
did they vote on the boat?
that marble is a marvel
they are repairing the curb on the curve
[vat_that]
is that the vat?
wilt thou repeat the vow?
the leather is never the lever
she loathes small loaves
she wrote clothe for clove
[veal_zeal]
he ate the veal with zeal
a weasel is bigger than a weevil
i hope it dries while we drive
there aer many ways to wave
what grows in the grove?
[thank_tank]
he taught what he thought
he said thanks for the tanks
it's a pity they've turned pithy
the cloth will help it clot
she brought some broth
[thank_shank]
the thief took a sheaf
the shrew is through
he's rethreading the reshredding machine
the welsh have great wealth
she is harsh if ashes are on the hearth
[thank_sank]
being thin is no sin
we saw the thaw
i don't think it will sink
besides being mossy it is all mothy
their gross shows a steady growth
[thy_thigh]
he will either get ether or novocain
please sheathe it in a sheath
the baby's teeth will soon teethe
they will wreathe him in a wreath
i am loth to loathe anyone
[than_dan]
i don't dare go there
are those the men who doze?
by then he'll be in the den
he loathes carrying big loads
how does this breed manage to breathe? 
[then_Zen]
it was then that they studied zen
stop teasing while she's teething
he lays it on the lathe
can you bathe in both bays?
breathe the fresh breeze
please sooth that friend of sue's
[knack_lack]
it is not a lot
you need to lead
my niece has the lease
it was the hound that howled
have you seen a seal?
[fan_fang]
tomorrow he wins his wings
the gong is gone
the clan heard the clang
the king is our kin
that thing is thin
[tack_pack]
put the tile in the pile
they were sitting and sipping
my pet has no pep
i think it is cheap to cheat
it will taste right when it is ripe
[tab_dab]
just dip the tip
i will try to make it dry
she was patting the padding
i can't wait to wade
will she send one cent?
[tap_chap]
its tip has a chip
you're in time for hear it chime
she is matching the matting
they each will eat
the bench is bent
[dash_rash]
it is dim on the rim
the ramp in damp
get a caddy to carry
it was stowed in the store
he was led in the lair
[dipper_zipper]
what will they do at the zoo?
that lady is lazy
they are sizing the siding
he made a maze
there are rows by the road
[dab_jab]
the jeep is in deep
we have a debt on the jet
the deans will not allow jeans
they are aiding the aging
has he paid for this page?
[lack_rack]
there is a light on the right
they were late in announcing the rate
bowling is boring
are they free to flee?
he is the bill for the beer
[sack_shack]
put the sack in the shack
this shoe fits sue
put a sheet on the seat
that is the last to be lashed
he belongs to a parish in paris
[seal_zeal]
i will sue the zoo
there is zinc in the sink
she will be fussy if it's fuzzy
the plays are in this place
it pays to keep a fast pace
[chatter_shatter]
there's a cherry in my sherry
those sheep are not cheap
do witches grant wishes?
we can't march in that marsh
there is too much of that mush
[jack_shack]
it will jell in the shell
the jack is in the shack
the sheep ae in the jeep
we were gypped when it was shipped
is marge in the marsh?
[jest_zest]
is joan in this zone?
he made the jest with zest
he gauges while he gazes
he pays for each page
the chains do not change
[jest_chest]
the jeep was not cheap
these cherries are jerry's
there are riches in those ridges
was marge going to march?
she is in search of a blue serge
[jam_yam]
is the jet here yet?
a bad yolk is no joke
it jarred our whole yard
they wedged it and weighed
it lay on the ledge
[bag_bang]
he can't juggle in the jungle
the costumer made wigs to match the wings
that log is long
the gang used a gag
pick a sprig at the spring 
[gap_cap]
they came for the game
the gold feels cold
you could do some good
the acrobat's ankles form strange angles
the dog is on the dock
