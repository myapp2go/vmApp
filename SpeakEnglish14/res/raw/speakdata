please sit in this seat
these shoes should fit your feet
do you still steal
those bins are for beans
they ship sheep
[beat_bait]
i hate this heat
they seen the same
the street is straight
the grain is green
set the tray under the tree
[beat_bet]
some men are mean
the dean has a den
the step is steep
will he sell the seal
we meet while buying meat
[bit_bait]
i hate to get hit
the pill made her pale
the were lit very late
that pin caused me pain
a large stick is a stake
[bit_bet]
he hid his head
fasten the pig to this peg
he slid on the sled
please check the chuck
a sore weist needs rest
[bit_bat]
that bag is big
give the ham to him
he always thinks to say thanks
this stick is for that stack
if you're fat it won't fit
[bit_but]
their hut was hit
that stick is stuck
that bug is too big
please hum this hymn
you can lick bad luck
[bait_bet]
did you get a new gate?
don't let them be late
please tell an exciting tale
don't wait until are wet
we must pay our debt on that date
[bait_bat]
i hate this hat
i am mad at the maid
use bait to catch a bat
the cap matches the cape
uncle sam is not the same
[bait_but]
i hate this hut
the make such a fusss over her face
the run in the rain
that sum is not the same
what can you gain with a gun
[bait_boat]
please taste the toast
is blows on the blaze
bring a cake and a coke
the goat broke the gate
a bear will doze for days
[vvvv]
has the yacht sailed yet?
